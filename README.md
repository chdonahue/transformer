# Building a transformer from scratch

This is a repo to learn how to build a transformer from scratch. Planning to build out further infrastructure afterwards...
Might do some visualization of weights in the future...

### Setting up:
- Create a .env file in the base directory of the project
- Create a wandb account and enter: WANDB_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"


conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate transformer_env
